    <h1>Hi, I'm Janae</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a graduate student at The University of Leeds pursing a Master's in Geographical Information Systems. 
        My research interests lie in the fields of computational geography, geomorphology, and hydrology. 
        My ultimate goal is to utilize the power of GIS technology to contribute meaningfully to environmental preservation.
