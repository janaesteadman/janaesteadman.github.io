<p>The primary objective of this project was to create a hazard map that aids in identifying areas of potential risk related to oil facilities and natural features. Firstly, an environment model was created to characterise the ease of spreading over the surface based on elevation, slope and hydrology.  To evaluate hazards related to specific oil facilities, the environment model was used as a cost surface, attributing each pixel in the environment model raster with a cost value derived from the collective influence of elevation, slope, and proximity to waterways. Higher cost values indicate greater difficulty in traversing that location. 
</p>
<P>The cost raster was integrated with other relevant data layers (e.g., oil facility locations, buffer distances) to identify areas with higher likelihoods of hazards. A weighted approach was adopted to combine the individual hazard maps into a unified hazard map. This approach allowed for a more comprehensive representation of overall risk by considering the varying levels of significance of each oil facility. Lastly, the field calculator was utilised to determine the total area of each hazard category and the geocoding plugin was employed to further pinpoint areas of utmost concern.
