<p>The primary objective of this project was to create a hazard map that aids in identifying areas of potential risk related to oil facilities and natural features. Firstly, an environment model was created to characterise the ease of spreading over the surface based on elevation, slope and hydrology.  To evaluate hazards related to specific oil facilities, the environment model was used as a cost surface, attributing each pixel in the environment model raster with a cost value derived from the collective influence of elevation, slope, and proximity to waterways. Higher cost values indicate greater difficulty in traversing that location. 
</p>
<P>The cost raster was integrated with other relevant data layers (e.g., oil facility locations, buffer distances) to identify areas with higher likelihoods of hazards. A weighted approach was adopted to combine the individual hazard maps into a unified hazard map. This approach allowed for a more comprehensive representation of overall risk by considering the varying levels of significance of each oil facility. Lastly, the field calculator was utilised to determine the total area of each hazard category and the geocoding plugin was employed to further pinpoint areas of utmost concern.

<h3>Landscape Evolution, Valencia/Matura, Trinidad (1994-2022) </h3>
<h4>Undergraduate Dissertation, 2023</h4>
   <img src="/assets/img/final.jpeg" alt="Final">

<p>This map is part of a wider analysis into landscape evolution and fragmentation in Valencia/Matura, Trinidad and Tobago. Aerial photographs from 1994 covering the study area were obtained and high resolution images of 15 September 2022 were downloaded at 10 km eye altitude from Google Earth Pro archives. The 2022 image was georeferenced using QGIS with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 10 m by using the nearest neighbour resampling method. Both images were then mosaicked and the study area was extracted. The 1994 aerial photograph was then georeferenced to the 2022 image (image to image registration), with an RMSE of less than 30 m. For each photo, between 6 and 10 ground control points were selected. 
</p>

<p>  This study depends upon human photo interpretation to identify and delineate land cover classes, which were divided into two categories; forest and non-forest. The high resolution of the digital photographs ensured that the two classes of land cover types could be distinguished with a satisfactory degree of certainty, using criteria such as size, texture, colour, shape, and location. To achieve this, specific areas of land cover were identified, and their boundaries were manually delineated on-screen in the QGIS environment. Manual interpretation was necessary in this study due to the nature of the data sources, which typically have high spatial resolution but may not be suitable for automated classification methods. 
</p>

<p>To perform the accuracy assessment, the error matrix was used, which is one of the most widely used methods for assessing classification accuracy. To create the reference data for the error matrix, 20 polygons representing the two land cover classes (forest and non-forest) were delineated across the study area using Google Earth Satellite Imagery. The classified image and the reference data were loaded into the r.kappa algorithm in QGIS. The output file contained the Kappa coefficient, errors of commission, errors of omission and overall accuracy which were then used to calculate the user’s accuracy, and producer’s accuracy.
