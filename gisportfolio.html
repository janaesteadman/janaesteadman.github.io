<p> The primary objective of this project was to create a hazard map that aids in identifying areas of potential risk related to oil facilities and natural features. Firstly, an environment model was cheated to characterise the ease of spreading over the surface based on elevation, slope and hydrology. The characteristics of the surface influences the movement of the oil by assisting or impeding (Udoh and Ekanem 2011).  Elevation values were obtained using the STRM Downloader, and based on these values, a slope map was generated that classified slopes into several categories, including gentle, moderate, steep, extremely steep, and excessively steep. Data on waterways was obtained from the Humanitarian Data Exchange. It is important to note that the data which was analysed is a simplified representation of complex real-world phenomena. This study does not take into account other surface characteristics such as vegetation, soil texture, geomorphology or physiography. Including these factors in future analyses may give a better understanding of the movement of oil over impedance surfaces. Despite these limitations, the model is still valuable and can be used to perform further analysis.

To assess the hazards posed by oil pipelines, oil reserves, and tank farms, data from the 'Energy Map of Trinidad and Tobago' (Bush and Fuller, 2017) was sourced. The oil pipeline and oil reserve layers were georeferenced to ensure spatial accuracy, while tank farm locations were identified using Google Earth Pro. To evaluate hazards related to specific oil facilities, the environment model was used as a cost surface, attributing each pixel in the environment model raster with a cost value derived from the collective influence of elevation, slope, and proximity to waterways. Higher cost values indicate greater difficulty in traversing that location. The cost raster was integrated with other relevant data layers (e.g., oil facility locations, buffer distances) to identify areas with higher likelihoods of hazards.

A weighted approach was adopted to combine the individual hazard maps into a unified hazard map. The formula used was HM = (Pipelines_Hazard * 3) + (TankFarms_Hazard * 2) + (OilReserves_Hazard). This approach allowed for a more comprehensive representation of overall risk by considering the varying levels of significance of each oil facility. To make the hazard map more actionable, it was categorised into different levels, ranging from very low to very high hazard. This step provided a clear and concise visualisation of areas with different risk levels. The polygonised hazard map was used to extract spatial information, and the field calculator was utilised to determine the total area of each hazard category. Lastly, To further pinpoint areas of utmost concern, the geocoding plugin was employed, enabling the location of regions with very high hazard levels. This visualisation facilitated a focused understanding of critical areas and highlighted potential hotspots that require special attention.</p>
